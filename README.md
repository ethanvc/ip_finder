# ip_finder
lookup all ips for a specified domain name by ask all ipv4 dns server.

here is a little application for finding out all ips of a specified domain name. In the ip_list directory, 
i uploaded ip list of www.googole.com and all available dns server address at the time i run my application.

The technical method is pretty simple, just send dns package to all ip v4 address. By the way, i copied the dns package parser
frm chrome project.
